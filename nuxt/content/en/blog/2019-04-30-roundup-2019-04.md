> - **them**: *Are you still working on your website?*
> - **me**: *Uhm, yes. Yes I am*

I get asked this question regularly. Typically by people who know that this *website* thing is something I always seem to be working on. I rarely give it an answer with more detail than confirming that yes indeed, I am still working on it.

So today, I'd like to take a moment to explain in a little bit more detail what I've been working on in the last month or so.

As you may or may not know, I set out to rewrite FreeSewing (which I've started to write with capital F and capital S) because I wanted to make it easier for others to get involved in the project. For developers, or aspiring developers.

![Developers, developers, developers](/img/blog/roundup-2019-04/developers.gif)

So, I ported it to JavaScript, because [that's where the developers are](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages). 
The main library was completed somewhere around the end of last year. Since then, all patterns have been ported, and we started building [a new website](https://beta.freesewing.org/en/). 

So far so good, and there was a time when I had May in mind for a release date of freesewing 2.0. After all, once everything was put together, it worked fine. The only thing was that *putting everything together* was a bit of a headache.

JavaScript is a simple language to pick up and learn. But the surrounding ecosystem can be daunting to navigate. There's not just JavaScript, there's different versions of the language, with different features, and whether you can use them are not depends on the platform you're targeting. But don't worry, just configure Babel to transpile all your code for the target environment, and use webpack or rollup to bundle it. At least what you need, because you want to keep your peer dependencies out of the bundle so that.... ðŸ˜±

Thin
is the ugly side of JavaScript. Conquering it can be frustrating. So recently, I set out to address some of these things to make our life simpler.

## Freesewing is now a monorepo

Whereas the 1.x version of freesewing bundles everything in one application (oh those were simpler times) the 2.x version is modular. Patterns are their own thing, and there's plugins that you can hook into the library.

That is nice and elegant, but it is not without side effects. For one thing, mix-and-matching all those versions can be a bit of a headache. You've got this pattern which is version so and so, with that plugin version this, and freesewing version that. Will that all work together? Perhaps?

In addition, all patterns, plugins, and the main library itself live in their own repository.  Which on its own was becoming a pain to manage. To address that particular friction, we've switched to a monorepo model using [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/).

![The logo sort of explains what it does. Well played Lerna.](/img/blog/roundup-2019-04/lerna.svg)

The [freesewing repository on GitHub](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing) now bundles what used to be 47 individual repositories. It holds all the software we publish on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), where JavaScript packages live.

In addition, we've opted for a fixed versioning model. Meaning that all our packages follow the same release schedule. No more wondering whether this version of a plugin works with that version of a pattern. When we publish a new version, we'll publish a set of all packages that is guaranteed to work together.

## We're splitting developer and maker documentation

To limit the bundle size of our frontend projects (read, websites) we'll be splitting up our documentation between maker docs (how to sew the patterns and so on) and developer docs (how to use our code, design your own patterns, add translations, and so on).
Maker documentation will remain on freesewing.org, whereas our developer docs will be hosted on freesewing.dev, which we picked up for that purpose.
This is a work in progress. Until the time it's setup, you can continue to find all our developer docs for the new system on beta.freesewing.org.

## A subdomain per language

Another thing we're changing is that we'll deploy a subdomain per language.
This allows us to deploy a language-specific site for each language, rather than having the ship the content and translations for all languages in the website.

It will also allow is to use the same URLs for different languages (and a different domain, obviously).

So, in practice, freesewing.org will be the same as en.freesewing.org. The French site will live at fr.freesewing.org, the Spanish one at es.freesewing.org, and so on.
Obviously, you'll still be able to pick your language on the site, and you'll end up in the correct place.

## Shared React components with storybook

Since we'll be having different websites, it makes sense to share code between them. So we've started building [a set of shared React components](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/tree/develop/packages/components) with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

This is not merely about us re-using code. If you want to use FreeSewing in your own projects, you can easily pull in these components to jump-start your development.
Furthermore, we've published [our CSS](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/tree/develop/packages/css-theme) and [Material-UI theme](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/tree/develop/packages/mui-theme) separately, so you can re-use our code, yet give it your own look and feel.

## npm init freesewing-pattern

The last thing on our todo list for a great developer experience is a so-called NPM initializer package.

The idea is that to get started with pattern develpment, all you have to do is run one command:

```js
npm init freesewing-pattern
```

It will ask you a bunch of questions, and then setup your development environment, complete with webpack configured for hot reloading, and a custom frontend to track your progress, and tweak the options of your pattern.

It is inspired by [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) and while it's a given that we won't be able to match the polish of an army of Facebook engineers, I am hopeful that it will significantly lower the bar for future contributors.


So yeah, I'm still working on that website.
