## Catherine Yu is now in charge of Diversity & Inclusion

![Catherine Yu](/img/blog/roundup-2019-03/catherine.jpg)

I am really happy to announce that Catherine Yu has accepted to be in charge of diversity and inclusion here at Freesewing.

Catherine is a seasoned contributor to freesewing. In the commit count for our work on version 2, she is second only to yours truly. Suffice to say she has earned her stripes.

I have always strived for freesewing to be a diverse and inclusive community. And I do believe that our track record is pretty good. But at the end of the day, I am a white cis-gender male, so I need all the help I can get.

Catherine has pointed out situations where I used language or phrasing that was biased. That she not only identifies these issues, but goes to bat for them is why I have asked her to formally take up this role.

Catherine's new position does not absolve any of us from our shared responsibility to build a diverse and inclusive community. But, if you identify a problem, if you discriminated against, or if you have ideas to help us do even better, you can talk to Catherine about it.

You can reach Catherine via email at catherine@freesewing.org, and she is [@Kittycatou](https://gitter.im/Kittycatou) in our chat room and [on GitHub](https://github.com/Kittycatou).

## Would you like to run freesewing's social media accounts?

As part of our efforts to spread the workload a bit, I would like to hand over control of the freesewing social media accounts to somebody who believes in the freesewing project, shares its values, and knows their way around a smartphone ðŸ˜€

Specifically, this person â€” or these people â€” would run:

 - [Our Twitter account](https://twitter.com/freesewing_org)
 - [Our Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/freesewing_org/)
 - [Our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/freesewing.org/)


> *I realize this sounds a bit like a job posting, so I should clarify that this is not a paid position. Freesewing is not a company, there are no paid positions here.*


If you think what we do is valuable, and you want to volunteer some of your time, 
please write to joost@freesewing.org, or contact freesewing_org
